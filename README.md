# laravel-ovh
Hello darkness, my old friend.

# Alright, real talk.
Can I just say that SyS/OVH/Kimsufi web console is just a nightmare to work with.
- OVH web console is just SLOW. And lacks a billion features that the API has.
- SyS IP management (including failover IPs) are just asininely terrible that you cannot modify
  multiple MAC addresses at the same time.
- Kimsufi shares the same issues with SyS.

And this is where laravel-ovh comes in.

# WTF is laravel-ovh?
laravel-ovh intends to be the alternative method to manage your servers in the OVH universe. You don't really _need_ it per se, but it would improve your quality of life managing your servers. Guaranteed.

# OI chong601, I can't do X. I want the "guarantee" you claim to provide.
